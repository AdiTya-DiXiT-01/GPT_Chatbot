TimeoutError in iPad mobile app and browser.,For Synchronous calls iBPS Mobile app and iOS browsers are showing TimeoutError within 12 seconds. We are getting timeout for NG Product API's executeServerEvent() function in iOS mobile application and browser even when the request is Synchronous.,"We do not put any timeout on our synchronous ajax calls. This can be evident from the fact that the reported error is only observed in iPAD safari browser and iBPSMobile for IOS devices while working in all other environments. This may be due to some internal timeout in safari browser setting (this can be researched on internet) .
    As informed , your API takes 12-25 seconds to process . It is not recommended by product to call any such API from front end which takes more than 3 seconds. Either the external API should be made faster or implementation design should be changed.
   Making executeServerEvent() call asynchronous can remove this timeout error issue , but it should be implemented taking care that API execution is completed before workitem is closed by user . Please discuss this within your team or with AR team for a proper design solution.",

And as your iBPS version is very old. So, we cannot provide any resolution for multiple TLS versions enablement. So, Kindly Upgrade to Ibps4 Sp1 Patch4 as per your Ibps version as this thing was already communicated at that time when we provided the office365 fix.

Also, as checked the MSgraph.ini file, there are multiple entries for same initiation agent in which issue is persisting. So, Kindly verify the configurations.

Hence, closing the ticket. Also, make sure you understood the resolution comments of the ticket before reopening it.",As it is already mentioned in the prerequisites of the hotfix release for office365 support that TLSv1.2 should be enabled on system. There is a workaround for your issue to enable multiple TLS versions is that you can create the separate node and enable TLSv1.2 only over it and run the InitiationAgent over there.

not able to login by sso in omnidocs,,"The error message you provided suggests that there was an authentication failure when attempting to use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java (Msal4j) to interact with a server.

Here are a few possible causes for this error:

Incorrect credentials: Double-check the credentials (such as username and password) being used for authentication. Ensure that they are accurate and properly entered.

Invalid or expired tokens: If you are using access or refresh tokens for authentication, they may have become invalid or expired. In such cases, you will need to obtain new tokens by initiating the authentication process again.

Misconfigured application or service: Verify that the application or service you are trying to authenticate with is properly configured to accept the authentication requests. Check the settings, permissions, and configurations associated with the application or service.

Network or connectivity issues: It's possible that there are network or connectivity problems preventing successful authentication. Ensure that the server hosting the authentication service is accessible and that there are no firewall restrictions or other network-related issues.

Server-side authentication failure: The error message indicates that the server returned an authentication failure. This could mean that the server itself encountered an issue while processing the authentication request. In such cases, it's advisable to contact the server administrator or check the server logs for more specific information about the cause of the failure.

To troubleshoot this issue further, you may want to examine the complete stack trace or error logs to gather more details about the error. Additionally, consulting the documentation or support resources provided by Microsoft for MSAL or the specific service you are integrating with may offer more insights into resolving this error.",

Vulnerability for Older Log4j in Axis2 war Library,"We are getting the below vulnerability in the servers due to older Log4j versions on the below highlighted location :

According to its self-reported version number, the installation of Apache Log4j on the remote host is no longer supported. Log4j reached its end of life prior to 2016. Lack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor. As a result, it is likely to contain security vulnerabilities. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.

Vulnerabilities in Newgen Prod Servers,"Hi Rohini,

As per the VA report, TLS, SSL and Weak Cipher algorithms are reflecting as vulnerable and we need to disable old versions to mitigate the VA. Requesting to check application/DB compatibility with TLS as TLS changes will impact the application/DB communication. 

Please find the below action plan to mitigate the VA and confirm us with the details to proceed and mitigate the VA. If any concern, feel free to highlight.

Plan Of Action To Mitigate VA:

1.	Disable TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0 – Application/DB team confirmation required
2.	Enable TLS 1.2 with strong .net encryption – Application/DB team confirmation required
3.	Disable Cipher Algorithms DES, 3DES, RC2, RC4, NULL – No Impact as by default Windows Servers are using AES Cipher Algorithm and others are Vulnerable.
4.	Restart the server for immediate effect.","Product already supports TLS1.2 and SSL certificate depends upon the app server compatibility

For algorithm query Please Raise a ticket to web team.","Product already supports TLS1.2 and SSL certificate depends upon the app server compatibility

Vulnerabilities Escalated by AU SmallFinance Bank,"As per recent guidelines given by RBI, Following Items are escalated by Senior Management of Au Small FInance Bank and these points needs to be fixed and  implemented asap in Production to remain compliant with the RBI Guidelines:
1.Proper X-Content-Type-Options Implementation
Required for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) sniffing (also known as “content sniffing”) can occur when a website allows users to upload data to the server. This is important if a user uploads an HTML page when the web server expects a different content type. When the web server sends the data back to a browser, the browser may interpret it as a web page even though the web server intended it to be (say) a CSV. See the Fetch Living Standard for details on the processing performed by browsers.

Recommendations:
· Concatenate all the X-Content-Type-Options headers together.
· Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to “nosniff.

2.Proper Cache-Control Implementation
Required for HTTP/1.1
This field sets conditions for storing data in the browser cache. The cache-control header is defined in RFC-7234. For cache-response verification, a no-cache directive is sufficient for a good response.

Please find the below the current Au Small Finance Bank Current Environment Details:
Windows Server=2012 R2
